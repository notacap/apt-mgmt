# Project Context

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive web-based platform for apartment management companies, designed to streamline operations between landlords/owners, employees, and tenants. The technical stack includes Django for the backend, with HTMX, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. The platform features role-based dashboards, document management, maintenance tracking, rent collection, and communication tools.

## Tech Stack

- Django
- HTMX
- Alpine.js
- Tailwind CDN
- SQLite 3

## Work Completed

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup** has been fully completed. The key accomplishments include:
- Initialized the Django project with a scalable, multi-app structure.
- Configured the frontend development environment and a base template with a light/dark mode toggle.
- Defined and migrated database models for multi-tenancy (`Company`, `Property`, `ApartmentUnit`).
- Implemented a custom user model with role-based permissions and resolved all migration conflicts.
- Set up initial URL routing for placeholder dashboards.

**Phase 2: User Management** has been fully completed. The key accomplishments include:
- Built the superuser admin interface by registering all relevant models.
- Created a system for new landlord account and company creation.
- Ensured property and unit management is available to superusers via the admin.
- Built a user invitation system with a model, form, and view.
- Implemented profile management for all user types.
- Established role-based dashboard redirection after login, including login/logout views.

**Phase 3: Core Dashboard Features** has been fully completed. The key accomplishments include:
- **Built notification system with badge display**: Created a `Notification` model in the `communication` app with notification types, recipient targeting, and badge display in the header navigation.
- **Created reusable metric card components**: Developed reusable metric card template with customizable icons, colors, and trend indicators.
- **Implemented landlord dashboard with all metric cards**: Built comprehensive landlord dashboard featuring all required metrics (rent income, expenses, revenue, maintenance requests, payment status, occupancy rate, lease expirations, vacant units) with property selector and recent activity sections.
- **Added property selector with filtered views**: Implemented property filtering dropdown in the landlord dashboard header.
- **Created employee dashboard layout**: Built employee-focused dashboard with maintenance management, schedule view, document access, and communication features.
- **Built tenant dashboard structure**: Developed tenant self-service portal with rent management, maintenance requests, document access, and messaging capabilities.

## Key Architectural Decisions & Fixes
- **Corrected User/Property Hierarchy**: The invitation system was updated to enforce the correct business logic. When a landlord or employee sends an invitation, they must now select a specific property belonging to their company. The invited user is automatically associated with both the company and the selected property upon registration.
- **Programmatic Group Permissions**: User groups ("Landlords", "Employees", "Tenants") and their associated model permissions are now created automatically via a Django data migration. This ensures a consistent and version-controlled permission setup.
- **Fixed Admin User Creation**: The Django admin for the User model was customized to display and allow editing of the custom `role` and `company` fields. This fixed a critical bug where users created via the admin were not being assigned a role, causing login redirection to fail.
- **Resolved Migration Conflicts**: A significant migration conflict (InconsistentMigrationHistory) arose after implementing the custom user model. This was resolved by resetting the `users` app migrations and rebuilding them, which required a one-time database reset and recreation of user accounts.
- **Fixed Logout Functionality**: Corrected the logout process by replacing the GET request link with a POST request form. This ensures secure and reliable user logout, preventing CSRF vulnerabilities and fixing a bug where users were not being properly logged out.

## Current Tasks & Next Steps

We have completed **Phase 4: Document Management**. Key accomplishments include:

- **Implemented secure file upload system**: Configured Django's file handling with UUID-based filenames for security
- **Created role-based document access control**: Multi-level permissions (company, property, unit, private) with user/role restrictions
- **Built comprehensive document sharing system**: Users can share documents with notifications and audit trails
- **Developed document management UI**: Upload, view, download, delete functionality with category organization
- **Integrated document sections into all dashboards**: Role-appropriate document access for landlords, employees, and tenants
- **Added document categories**: Pre-populated with apartment management categories (leases, financial, maintenance, etc.)

We have completed **Phase 5: Maintenance System** with comprehensive enhancements. Key accomplishments include:

**Core Maintenance Features:**
- **Created comprehensive maintenance models**: Built MaintenanceRequest, MaintenanceCategory, MaintenancePhoto, MaintenanceUpdate, and MaintenanceInvoice models with full workflow support
- **Implemented secure photo upload system**: UUID-based file handling for maintenance request photos with multiple image support and download functionality
- **Built tenant request creation interface**: Complete form system allowing tenants to submit requests with photos, descriptions, and priority settings
- **Developed management interfaces for staff**: Landlord and employee dashboards with status updates, assignment capabilities, and progress tracking
- **Added complete status tracking system**: Full workflow from submission through completion with update timeline and audit trail

**Enhanced Invoice Management:**
- **Removed estimated cost tracking**: Streamlined system to focus on actual invoice-based cost tracking
- **Implemented full invoice CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, delete functionality for maintenance invoices
- **Added invoice-documents integration**: Invoices automatically create document records in "Maintenance Records" category
- **Built comprehensive invoice management**: Edit invoice details, replace files, proper version control

**Security & Access Control:**
- **Fixed document access control vulnerability**: Resolved security flaw where tenants could access invoices despite role restrictions
- **Implemented strict role-based invoice access**: Only landlords and employees can view financial information
- **Enhanced permission enforcement**: Proper isolation of sensitive financial data from tenants

**UI/UX Enhancements:**
- **Improved form field sizing**: Better padding and input field dimensions throughout maintenance interface
- **Enhanced photo management**: Download functionality for maintenance photos with hover controls
- **Optimized layout organization**: Moved invoices section for better visual hierarchy and wider display
- **Enhanced filter controls**: Larger, more usable filter dropdowns and search inputs on maintenance list
- **Added navbar dashboard navigation**: Clickable "AptMgmt" brand link for quick dashboard access

**System Integration:**
- **Seamless documents module integration**: Maintenance invoices appear in documents with proper categorization
- **Role-appropriate visibility**: Different user types see appropriate information based on their permissions
- **Comprehensive search and filtering**: Advanced list management with status, priority, and search capabilities
- **Scheduling functionality**: Date/time scheduling for maintenance appointments with assignment tracking

We are now ready to begin **Phase 6: Communication Features**.

The immediate next tasks are:
- **Build direct messaging system**: Enable communication between tenants, employees, and landlords
- **Implement message recipient selection**: Role-based messaging with proper permission controls
